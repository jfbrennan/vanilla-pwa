# Vanilla PWA
Everything you need to start building a PWA and nothing you don't.

This is a good starting point to learn core PWA requirements and features. It is not a framework or CLI or plugin and it has no dependencies. It's just the minimum code needed to get a PWA with:
- Discoverability in app stores
- Installability on all platforms
- Branded UX
- Offline support
- Other features stubbed and ready for use

From here, you build your app using whatever tech stack you prefer✌️
